1. Build

The official build system for Gesamt is part of CCP4 Software Suite and may be
found at

http://devtools.fg.oisin.rc-harwell.ac.uk/src-readme.html

However, the quickest way to build Gesamt is by issuing the following command:

cd /path/to/gesamt-dist; g++ -I src src/*.cpp src/*/*.cpp -lz -O3 -o gesamt

in terminal window (you may need to adjust this line depending on peculiarities
of C++ compiler setup on your system). This will create Gesamt executable
"gesamt" in the root of distribution directory. 


2. Usage Instructions

Run "gesamt" without parameters to get full list of options and common examples.


3. Quick Start

Suppose PDB archive be at $PDB. For making fast structural queries, it should be
first pre-processed by Gesamt. Make a new directory for the processed archive, and
assume it is located at $GESAMT_ARCHIVE. Then the processing is done with the
following command:

  ./gesamt --make-archive $GESAMT_ARCHIVE -pdb $PDB -npacks=N

In this command, N should be set in 2**x multiples of the number of parallel
threads that will be used in structural searches. For example, if archive will
be used on machines with 8 cores, and all 8 cores will be used in parallel,
then N shouod be about 16x8=128. If structural searches will be done on the
same machine as one used for pre-processing, "-npacks" parameter may be omitted
or set to "-npacks=auto". Larger pack numbers allow for better load ballancing
between parallel threads, but excessive number of packs may result in a slowdown
of file read operations. Therefore, do not make too many or too few packs; 128,
256 and 512 should suit most situations. The pre-processing may take from few
hours to a day depening on hardware specifications.

After pre-processing, structural queries are run with the following command:

  ./gesamt 1xyz.pdb -s "/1/A" -archive $GESAMT_ARCHIVE -min1=0 -min2=0 -nthreads=M -o out.txt

Here, "/1/A" selects chain "A" from 1st model in input file 1xyz.pdb. Note
that some PDB file contain several models, and some of them are numerated
from inidces higher than 1. "-min1=0 -min2=0" make Gesamt to try every structural
pair, even if it does not promise a reasonable-quality alignment. See the meaning
of these parameters in Usage Instructions. "-nthreads" specifies the desirable
number of parallel threads to use. "-nthreads=auto" will use all machine's cores,
which may be suboptimal in case of hyperthreading. The output file, specified
with "-o" option, will contain the list of comparisons between input chain
and all chains in $GESAMT_ARCHIVE.

Gesamt archive may be updates, rather than regenerated anew, when PDB receives
new structures. The update is done with the following command:

  ./gesamt --update-archive $GESAMT_ARCHIVE -pdb $PDB

A typical update (~100 new structures) takes only a few minutes.
